/*
Geek is busy solving problems on Bitwise operators. Today while solving problems, he
observed something which intrigued him very much. ะะต discovered that there are some awesome pairs in
a list of integers whose Bitwise AND is strictly greater than Bitwise XOR among them.
Given a list arr[] of N integers find the number of awesome pairs.
Example 1:
  Input:
  N = 4
 arr[] = {6, 2, 5, 3}
  Output: 2
  Explanation:
  Awesome pairs are (6, 5) and (2, 3).
Example 2:
  Input:
  N = 3
 arr[] = {1, 1, 1}
  Output: 3
  Explanation: All pairs are awesome.
Your Task:
 You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function pairs() that takes the
 array arr[] and its size N as input parameters and return the number of awesome pairs.
 Constraints:
 1 <= N <= 10^6
 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
